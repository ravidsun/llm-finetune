---

### [Phase 4: Evaluation & Export](PHASE4_EVALUATION.md)
⏱️ Time: 30 minutes - 2 hours

Evaluate your fine-tuned model and export it for deployment.

**You'll learn**:
- Testing model with sample prompts
- Comparing base vs fine-tuned performance
- Merging LoRA adapter with base model
- Exporting to different formats (GGUF, ONNX)
- Benchmarking inference speed

**Outputs**:
- ✅ Merged model (full weights)
- ✅ Exported model (GGUF/ONNX)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Evaluation results

---

### [Phase 5: Deployment](PHASE5_DEPLOYMENT.md)
⏱️ Time: 1-4 hours (depending on deployment method)

Deploy your model for production use.

**You'll learn**:
- Local deployment with llama.cpp
- RunPod Serverless deployment
- HuggingFace Inference Endpoints
- vLLM for high-throughput serving
- Building custom FastAPI servers
- Production best practices

**Outputs**:
